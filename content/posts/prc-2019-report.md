CPAN Pull Request Challenge used to match CPAN maintainers to contributors. Contributors would sign up to receive monthly assignments. The goal was to submit at least one pull request. It was fun, but it came to an end at the end of 2018.

I wanted this challenge to go on, so I created Pull Request Club. It has been a whole year since it started, so here’s the annual report with some insights.

# New features

- While Pull Request Club took its basics from CPAN-PRC, I wanted to make it more self-served. Users can take various actions such as signing up or skipping an assignment with a few clicks.
- Users sign up to the site with their GitHub accounts. This lets them add their repositories to the assignment pool without hassle.
- Users can see both their “assignment history” and “assignee history”.

# Numbers

- We have reached 100+ users and 200+ repositories in the pool.
- 70 users have received at least 1 assignment.
- 16 of them have completed at least 1 assignment.
- Only 1 user has completed all 12 assignments.
- October was the month with most assignments completed (8), followed by January and March (7).
- 21 users have received at least 1 assignee.
- 14 of them have received at least 1 pull request.
- 170+ assignments were out this year.
- 60 of those were completed, meaning **users have submitted 60 pull requests**.

# Join us!

Does this sound interesting to you? Do you want to contribute to open source more in the new year? You can join us at [PullRequest.Club](https://pullrequest.club) today.

Feel free to sign up if you are only interested in getting more pull requests too. You can opt out of assignments while keeping your repositories in the pool.

If you sign up before the new year (and opt into receiving assignments), you will get an assignment on January 1st.
