Pull Request Club is a web app matching open source contributors with maintainers. This happens through monthly assignments: Maintainers' repos are assigned to contributors. Assignment is to submit at least one pull request.

Pull Request Club started as a successor to CPAN Pull Request Challenge. With the end of 2020, Pull Request Club has completed its second year. Here's the second annual report. See the one from last year [here](/posts/prc-2019-report).

# New Features

- Newcomers get a special [welcome assignment](http://github.com/kyzn/welcome-to-prc/) as soon as they sign up. This assignment is given 36 times and completed 9 times. 4 users who have completed the welcome assignment ended up doing more assignments.
- Users can subscribe to (or opt out from) different types of emails.
- Settings page got tabs. It used to list all settings in one page.
- Forked repos are now allowed as assignments.

# Numbers

| Statistic                                  |  End of 2019  |  End of 2020  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Total users                                |      104      |      154      |
| Total repos in assignment pool             |      226      |      250      |
| Contributors who got at least 1 assignment |       70      |      123      |
| Contributors who submitted at least 1 PR   |       16      |       29      |
| Maintainers who got at least 1 assignee    |       21      |       26      |
| Maintainers who received at least 1 PR     |       14      |       24      |
| Assignments given                          |      172      |      348      |
| Assignments completed (PR)                 |       60      |      133      |
| Assignment completion ratio                |    34.88%     |    38.22%     |

Here's the good news: Pull Request Club users have exchanged **133+ pull requests**! ðŸŽ‰ And assignment completion ratio went a bit up.

I should also note the difference between assignment-getters (123) vs pr-submitters (29). We have 94 people who signed up, received an assignment and left the site. I am looking for ways to bring them back.

# Top Three Users

Some of our users are breaking records with their love for open source. I'd like to give them a shout out here.

- [Mohammad S Anwar](https://github.com/manwar) - Mohammad is the only user who has received and completed 24 assignments! Great job. I'm sure in the next annual report this number will be 36.
- [HÃ¥kon HÃ¦gland](https://github.com/hakonhagland) - HÃ¥kon has joined Pull Request Club in late March of 2019. Since signing up he has received and completed all 21 assignments! Just wonderful.
- [E. Choroba](https://github.com/choroba) - Choroba has completed 18 assignments, which is a great number! In addition to completing assignments, Choroba's repositories are assigned to other people 15 times. He's both a great contributor and a great maintainer.
