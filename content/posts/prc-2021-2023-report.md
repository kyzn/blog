Pull Request Club is a web app matching open source contributors with maintainers. This happens through monthly assignments: Maintainers' repos are assigned to contributors. Assignment is to submit at least one pull request.

I've started the Pull Request Club as a successor to CPAN Pull Request Challenge in January 2019. See previous yearly reports below:
- [2019](/pull-request-club-2019-report)
- [2020](/pull-request-club-2020-report)

Unfortunately I didn't write reports for 2021 and 2022, so I'll try to cover the missing years here.


# New Things

- Project got [its own GitHub page](https://github.com/Pull-Request-Club/).

- Main social media account is now [Mastodon](https://floss.social/@PRC).

- Since "Hacktoberfest" got out of control with spammers, I added a quick note that is displayed during month of October

- To express my gratitude to most active members, I've decided to give one-time special t-shirts. With the generous help of Renée Bäcker, I was able to print some special t-shirts & ship them around the world.

- A new assignment status is implemented: **Timed out**. If an open assignment stays "open" for one year, its status will be updated as timed out. Assignee gets an email with an explanation, and they are automatically opted out from receiving new assignments. They can still login & turn it back on.


# Numbers

Overall stats are below. Two things to note:
- I've lost the calculation method I used in previous reports. Therefore you may see a difference between this report and previous ones.
- "The pool" stats for 2019 actually include 2018 numbers too. This is because the sign ups were opened in November 2018, but the first assignment was given in January 2019.

|    TOTAL    |  166  |  175  |  106  |  85  |  86  |  618  |



**Good news:** Number of pull requests that are exchanged by Pull Request Club members has gone up to 274 (compared to 132 of 3 years ago). Assignment completion rate is also trending upwards.

**Bad news:** The difference between assignment-getters vs pr-submitters stays wide open. In three years, assignment-getters increased by 51, whereas pr-submitteres increased only by 14.

To summarize, there's no big growth. But we still have a number of active users, which is what keeps me running the site.
