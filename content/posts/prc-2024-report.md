Pull Request Club is a web app matching open source contributors with maintainers. This happens through monthly assignments: Maintainers' repos are assigned to contributors. The assignment is to submit at least one pull request.

I started the Pull Request Club as a successor to CPAN Pull Request Challenge in January 2019. See previous yearly reports below:
- [2019](/pull-request-club-2019-report)
- [2020](/pull-request-club-2020-report)
- [2021-2023](/pull-request-club-2021-2023-report)

This post will cover the year of 2024.


# New Things

- Nothing new was implemented during 2024.


# Numbers

I have changed the metrics I analyze. Last year I focused on "New" data ("New" users, "New" repos etc.) This year instead of "new contributors", I've looked at "yearly active contributors".

### Contributors

We saw the numbers go down. 2024 was actually the worst year: there were only six users who submitted pull requests.

### Maintainers

Numbers haven't changed much over the years. We have 15 users getting PRs.

### Assignments

Both numbers are at their lowest. Total PRs have reached 300.

Overall, we see the numbers are going down. I want to spend more time on PRC but 2024 was not a good year to do it.

# Presentations

[E. Choroba let me know on Mastodon](https://floss.social/@choroba@mastodon.social/112501967649559284) that he presented a lightning talk about PRC in Helsinki. He shared the slides [here](https://e-choroba.eu/23-prclub/index.html#(1)) and the video is below. I am very thankful to him: He's both an active contributor and maintainer. Thanks for spreading the word, Choroba!
