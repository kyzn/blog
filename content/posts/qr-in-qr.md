The other day I got curious about QR codes. While doing some reading, I've come up with some ideas. One of them was QR in QR.

I've seen some QR codes that have an image in the middle, and even though the code is partially blocked it still scans thanks to the error correction. I wanted to try adding another QR code in place of this image, to see if I can scan both bigger code and smaller code. I looked up but couldn't find any QR codes within QR codes.

You can try scanning the whole QR code to get text "big", and focus on the inner QR code to get text "small".
