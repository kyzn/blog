    </header><p>Last week, I attended my very first YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference) at Orlando. While I feel I can write for pages, I want to talk only about several things, following the newest format &ldquo;online newspapers&rdquo; are using.</p>

<h2 id="1-usa-is-huge">1) USA is huge.</h2>
<p>I remember stories on Quora about tourists who tried to make a day trip to California all the way from New York, and I actually laughed at them too. So I knew the continent is big, I guess I never realized it is &ldquo;that&rdquo; big. I was at San Jose, California. I took a flight to Orlando with a stop at Dallas. These were almost 3 hours each. To top it all, Orlando is 3 hours ahead of California, so I also experienced a slight jetlag (not being able to fall asleep even if it&rsquo;s pretty late etc). But we made it safe and sound, so it was fine.</p>

<h2 id="2-yapc-is-not-pronounced-as-y-a-p-c">2) YAPC is not pronounced as Y-A-P-C.</h2>
<p>My life has been a lie. Well, it&rsquo;s not that bad, but I was very surprised to learn that &ldquo;YAPC&rdquo; is pronounced as yapth-zee instead of reading every single letter out loud.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kyzn">@kyzn</a> It’s pronounced “The Perl Conference” now. ? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/yapcna?src=hash">#yapcna</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gardner (@markjgardner) <a href="https://twitter.com/markjgardner/status/744937787535859716">June 20, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>You probably don&rsquo;t need to worry about that because it&rsquo;s no more YAPC. They decided to rename it as The Perl Conference. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if we are supposed to read it as tapth-zee, but I liked the change. You can take a look at Dan&rsquo;s talk below, where he talks about details. (Obligatory video-webcast praise goes here too. They were awesome!)</p>

<h2 id="3-perl-6-is-pretty-good">3) Perl 6 is pretty good.</h2>
<p>To be completely honest, I had my prejudice towards Perl 6. But it actually looks super nice! I listened Conway&rsquo;s keynote on Perl 6 very carefully (which you can too), and attended several beginner talks on Perl 6 (beginner track was a great idea). There are many things that changed, but for one, now you can access anything about arrays with @, as opposed to @ for array itself and $ for one particular thing in an array. Many new features can be replicated with several CPAN modules, if you want to have a taste of Perl 6 while still using Perl 5.</p>

<h2 id="4-people-actually-use-irc">4) People actually use IRC.</h2>
<p>After reading notes for first-timers at YAPC web site, I knew I had to install some sort of IRC client to my computer/smartphone. I truly had no idea how to even start. I basically searched for IRC in application store, installed the very first thing that came up, and I was online! I am glad I was: The chat is amazing. It almost felt like it&rsquo;s subtitles to talks I&rsquo;m listening to. It was very helpful  too: I had problems connecting to projector at testing room, and I couldn&rsquo;t resolve. So I sent a message to #yapc, and thanks to helpful people I was ready to go in just a few minutes. Now I really have to dive into IRC, install it so that I&rsquo;m online all the time as opposed to being online if your phone is connected. There was actually a talk on IRC, but I missed it. I&rsquo;ll see it as soon as possible though, thanks to video streaming!</p>

<h2 id="5-lightning-talks-are-fun-and-encouraging">5) Lightning talks are fun and encouraging.</h2>
<p>Another note for first-timers recommend not to miss a single lightning talk, because they were too much fun. I took the advice one step further: I actually had chance to make a lightning talk! I was very excited when I was told my talk idea sounds pretty good. So I spent Monday night preparing slides, rehearsing, and submitting. Next morning I learned I am on the list for the day! My presentation, if you ask me, went very well. I talked about the only CPAN module I&rsquo;ve ever built, which is topic for another blog post. I&rsquo;ve received very encouraging feedback afterwards. I really liked other presentations too! They were fun, and I learned quite a few things.</p>
