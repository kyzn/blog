    </header><p>3/14 is usually celebrated as pi-day, although it is not recognized as a public holiday (yet). This year, things get a little bit more interesting, as we get two more digits. This happens only once in a century: 3/14/15. Hence, we <em>must</em> celebrate it somehow.</p>
<p>What about, tweeting exactly on 3/14/15 9:26:53? Well, that might be early for a saturday morning (for some), and you might miss the exact second even if you&rsquo;re online. What if we delegate this celebration to an automated script? That sounds like an idea!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kyzn/Auto-Tweet-on-piday">This is the link</a> you should see to learn how to do it. Of all the geeky things you could do, leaving a mark at 10-digits-of-pi-date-time sounds pretty cool, or at least I thought so. &ldquo;Did you miss the chance to tweet on 11/11/11 11:11:11? Now here&rsquo;s something new you can&rsquo;t miss!&rdquo;</p>
