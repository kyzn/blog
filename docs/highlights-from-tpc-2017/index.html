    </header><h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>This list contains just a small number of talks that I personally thought are important/enjoyable for the most readers. This is by no means an official list curated by an organization. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFxdSVDA4v9Af3iutQxLI14m">YouTube playlist</a> for all awesome talks. I also encourage you to write your own blog about TPC. And yes, it&rsquo;s officially called &ldquo;Tipsy&rdquo; now!</p>
<h3 id="where-did-my-test-fail">Where did my test fail?</h3>
<p>Although I tried to select talks with videos, I had to make an exception for this one. I wasn&rsquo;t able to locate neither videos mentioned in this section.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Damian Conway talked about his new modules: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dios"><code>Dios</code></a> lets you declare classes with Perl 6 syntax, which uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Keyword::Declare"><code>Keyword::Declare</code></a> to declare a couple new keywords it needs. <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dx"><code>Data::Dx</code></a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Expr"><code>Test::Expr</code></a> also utilize &ldquo;adding new keywords&rdquo;. First one is a wrapper around <code>Data::Dumper</code>, and second one is a Test module that prints out source code when an error happens, which apparently was not a thing yet. Pretty awesome, right?</p>
<p>Luckily, Chad Granum (who is working on Test2) was in audience, and the very next day, he announced <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag"><code>Test2::Plugin::SourceDiag</code></a> on Lightning Talks, so this is a thing now! Thanks Damian &amp; Chad!</p>
<h3 id="polyglots">Polyglots!</h3>
<p>Between the advertisements (&ldquo;Start a Perl Mongers!&rdquo;, &ldquo;No no, start a Polyglot Group!&rdquo;, &ldquo;No, start both!&rdquo;) we did have a couple talks on several languages. Here&rsquo;s a bunch of them, but there are more at YouTube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think your one programming language is the best thing ever, you are doing life wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Hear the story of <em>BumpySkies</em>, an application which tells you when to expect turbulance on your flight. It works by looking at flight path <em>and</em> weather conditions.</p>

<p>Building a garage-door-controller running on Mojolicious, with Raspberry Pi. There&rsquo;s live demo too!</p>

<h2 id="lightning-talks">Lightning Talks</h2>
<p>This year&rsquo;s lightning talk submission form had an extra item: You had to pick whether your LT is serious or fun. I&rsquo;m going to show one on each end.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tpc-slide.png" alt="LT Submission Form"></p>
<h2 id="fun-stuff">Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>David Farrell talks about his <em>awesome</em> module <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Cache::Reddit"><code>Cache::Reddit</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="serious-business">Serious Business</h2>
<p>One thing that most attendees must have noticed is the gender ratio in the conference. If you look at <a href="http://yapc-surveys.org/html/yn2016-survey.html">last year&rsquo;s post-conference survey results</a>, this is the gender ratio you will see:</p>
<p><img src="/images/tpc-survey.png" alt="Gender ratio in TPC 2016"></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look good at all, and we have to do something about it. Let&rsquo;s hear it from Deidre Foster.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7N3dR2y3Fi8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>We <strong>have to</strong> do something about it. We should encourage female coworkers/friends to attend and submit talks. We should <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/where-does-gender-bias-start-in-the-job-ads/">update our job ads to be gender-neutral</a>. We should <a href="https://www.hiremorewomenintech.com/">hire more woman in tech</a>. We should <a href="http://fogknife.com/2017-05-18-i-want-the-perl-conference-to-steal-cons-policies.html">have more policies</a> to make TPC better.</p>
<h2 id="speaking-of-surveys">Speaking of surveys..</h2>
<p>If you have attended the conference, survey submissions are due July 7th. Make sure to tell organizers/speakers what you think, make your voice heard. Help people improve what they love to do.</p>
<h2 id="you-should-submit-a-talk-too">You <strong>should</strong> submit a talk too!</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole year until the next TPC::NA, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to submit a talk - or multiple talks. Start thinking now. From now on, when you do something interesting, ask yourself if people would like to hear about that. (Spoiler alert: Yes they do!) Take notes, create a very brief outline of your ideas. Keep shaping it, then just submit it. Look for other conferences too!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
