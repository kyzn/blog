    </header><p>While working on a Perl project, I have received an error message that I have never seen before. I did take a look at search engines, but no solutions there helped me. In the end I was able to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong, so I thought I should share it here.</p>
<pre><code>Util.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched (got handshake key 0xc280000, needed 0xc180000)
</code></pre>
<p>This is more likely to happen if you are dealing with multiple versions of <code>perl</code> (note the word &ldquo;mismatched&rdquo;). For me though, that&rsquo;s usually not the case: I tend to download latest stable version via perlbrew and use it in all places.</p>
<p>Two solutions I could find online were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear <code>PERL5LIB</code> and <code>PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT</code> environment variables</li>
<li>Reboot your system</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither worked for me. Those environment variables were already not set, and a reboot didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>Turns out my issue was related to <code>carton</code>. See, very recently I reinstalled everything on my machine. And before doing so, I backed up my work folder to an external memory. Once my system was up again, I went to grab latest stable <code>perl</code> from perlbrew. Just before I did that a new version (5.30.0) was released. Do you see where it&rsquo;s going?</p>
<p>My backed up project included carton&rsquo;s locally installed modules folder: <code>local/</code>. But those modules were installed when latest stable version was 5.28.2, hence the &ldquo;mismatch&rdquo;. Solution was to remove <code>local/</code>, and reinstall modules with <code>carton install</code>.</p>
