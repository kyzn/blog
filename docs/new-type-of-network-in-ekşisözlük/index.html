    </header><p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about Ekşi Sözlük on the blog, the 1999-born Turkish social-network, but I have to confess I visit the site almost daily. There is also a CPAN module named WWW::Eksisozluk that I developed, as I think data on the site is very valuable. I&rsquo;ve also witnessed several changes the platform went through, including the latest one I&rsquo;m about the write on.</p>
<p>As a quick explanation, the site is formatted as a user-based dictionary. Users can create topics, or add definitions (entries) to topics. Users are able to upvote &amp; downvote entries for years now. A rather new feature allowed users to mark entries they like as &lsquo;favourites&rsquo;, just as in Twitter.</p>
<p>The latest change? There are now two new tabs on profile page: First one is to show authors whose entries are marked as favourite by the user. Second one is the same, except it works the other way: It shows the list of authors who marked user&rsquo;s entries as favourite. Both lists are short: They only show latest several authors, although how the list is ranked is unknown to anyone but developers. And these lists are dynamic, they come with a note saying &rsquo;last month only&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There is still one week for us to experiment with a social network as a homework for cooperation technologies class, but I guess I&rsquo;ve decided what to work on. We can even build a tool that would allow authors to see their dynamic networks to a number of degrees, that could be fun.</p>
