    </header><p>Pull Request Club is a web app matching open source contributors with maintainers. This happens through monthly assignments: Maintainers&rsquo; repos are assigned to contributors. Assignment is to submit at least one pull request.</p>
<p>Pull Request Club started as a successor to CPAN Pull Request Challenge. With the end of 2020, Pull Request Club has completed its second year. Here&rsquo;s the second annual report. See the one from last year <a href="/posts/prc-2019-report">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="new-features">New Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Newcomers get a special <a href="http://github.com/kyzn/welcome-to-prc/">welcome assignment</a> as soon as they sign up. This assignment is given 36 times and completed 9 times. 4 users who have completed the welcome assignment ended up doing more assignments.</li>
<li>Users can subscribe to (or opt out from) different types of emails.</li>
<li>Settings page got tabs. It used to list all settings in one page.</li>
<li>Forked repos are now allowed as assignments.</li>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the good news: Pull Request Club users have exchanged <strong>133+ pull requests</strong>! ðŸŽ‰ And assignment completion ratio went a bit up.</p>
<p>I should also note the difference between assignment-getters (123) vs pr-submitters (29). We have 94 people who signed up, received an assignment and left the site. I am looking for ways to bring them back.</p>
<h1 id="top-three-users">Top Three Users</h1>
<p>Some of our users are breaking records with their love for open source. I&rsquo;d like to give them a shout out here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/manwar">Mohammad S Anwar</a> - Mohammad is the only user who has received and completed 24 assignments! Great job. I&rsquo;m sure in the next annual report this number will be 36.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hakonhagland">HÃ¥kon HÃ¦gland</a> - HÃ¥kon has joined Pull Request Club in late March of 2019. Since signing up he has received and completed all 21 assignments! Just wonderful.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/choroba">E. Choroba</a> - Choroba has completed 18 assignments, which is a great number! In addition to completing assignments, Choroba&rsquo;s repositories are assigned to other people 15 times. He&rsquo;s both a great contributor and a great maintainer.</li>
