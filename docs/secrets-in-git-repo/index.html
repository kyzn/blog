    </header><p>It’s no secret that keeping secrets in a git repository is a bad idea. I want to do the mental exercise of imagining what can go wrong. I need to limit this to a point so as not to come up with far-fetched attack vectors like “Aliens invade the earth and they figured out all our prime numbers”. So here is a quick-list of some things that can go wrong when you add secrets to your repo.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some devs may assume the secret is not a real secret because it’s in a repo. This may result in <strong>sharing the secret in other channels like email or Slack</strong> by mistake. Likewise, <strong>the secret may be logged</strong> by mistake and may show up in even more places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an employee leaves your company, <strong>they become an outsider who knows your secrets</strong>. You may choose to rotate your keys every time an employee leaves, but there may be an easier alternative. If you&rsquo;re using a vault, you can set up which employees have access to which secrets. You also get access logs so that&rsquo;s another plus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the repo is leaked (either by mistake or on purpose), <strong>your secret is leaked</strong> too. The secret you put into the repository lives in all computers that clone the repository. This increases the chance of the leak happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You may lose reputation</strong> when your code with secrets is leaked and it makes into news. <strong>You may be sued by some customers</strong> who saw this and thought you don&rsquo;t have good enough security or you broke a policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your code is fed into a LLM (Large Language Models), <strong>attackers may retrieve it with prompt injection</strong>. They can tell ChatGPT how their grandma used to tell them passwords when they were trying to fall asleep.</p>
</li>
</ol>
