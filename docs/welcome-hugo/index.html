    </header><p>I’ve moved my blog from one static site generator to another. I used to use a <a href="https://github.com/kyzn/mini-plerd">stripped clone</a> of <a href="https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd">Plerd</a> to generate html files. To be clear, that was a nice setup! Now I’m using <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> to generate static content, from the very same markdown files.</p>
<p>I never was able to maintain mini-plerd (the stripped Plerd clone I mentioned above) as I hoped. Plerd upstream got updates, and I missed it. I didn’t even have markdown tables until very recently! I should have used the original Plerd.</p>
<p>Hugo comes with <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">many theme choices</a>. You need to pick one and go. Themes are easy enough to configure, and looks like easy enough to switch as well.</p>
<p>Another change I made was the way I deploy the blog. I used to upload my files to a DigitalOcean droplet, and serve my blog via nginx. That alone cost me $5/month. I could have used a storage like AWS S3 or DigitalOcean Spaces too. I’m now using <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>, where you put your files into a repository and GitHub serves it for free. It works with custom domains too, so that’s great.</p>
<p>So far I love Hugo. It&rsquo;s very easy to write new posts in local development environment.</p>
