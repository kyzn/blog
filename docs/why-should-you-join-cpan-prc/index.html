    </header><p><em>This blog is originally posted on <a href="https://perldotcom.perl.org/article/why-should-you-join-cpan-prc/">perl.com</a>, edited by <a href="https://www.perl.com/authors/david-farrell/">David Farrell</a>.</em></p>
<p>The CPAN Pull Request Challenge (PRC) aims to improve the quality of code on <a href="https://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, the online archive of Perl modules, by having participants submit pull requests to CPAN module authors.</p>
<p>Every month participants are assigned a new module to improve, and submit <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">pull requests</a> to the module repo on GitHub. Participants are not competing with each other, rather the &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; is to keep up with your monthly assignments.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-sign-up">How to sign up</h3>
<p>You can join as an individual or as a team. A team could be your company, you and a few friends, or your local Perl Mongers group.</p>
<p>Simply email Neil Bowers (&ldquo;neil at bowers dot com&rdquo;) your GitHub username and PAUSE ID if you have one, or if joining as a group, your GitHub organization name. Tell him you want to join the challenge, and you are in!</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>Once per month, you will receive an email noting your assigned distribution:</p>
<p><img src="/images/pr-assignment.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can fix a failing test, fix an issue, correct a typo, any kind of improvement. If you&rsquo;re not sure where to start, there are services on top of CPAN that can help identify issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a> is a Continuous Integration service that often identifies issues with failing tests and/or platform specific bugs</li>
<li><a href="https://rt.cpan.org/">Request Tracker</a> is the default bug tracker for CPAN modules (issues may also be listed on GitHub)</li>
<li><a href="http://cpancover.com">CPAN Cover</a> reports on code coverage for tests</li>
<li><a href="https://cpants.cpanauthors.org/">CPANTS</a> is a &ldquo;kwalitee&rdquo; assessment tool</li>
</ul>
<p>A good place to start is <a href="https://metacpan.org">metacpan</a>, a CPAN search engine which links to all of the above services. Scan through the module documentation and related information, to try and find things that need fixing or enhancing.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve identified the changes you&rsquo;d like to make, fork the module on GitHub, commit your changes and open a pull request with the new changes. Then reply to your assignment email saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;, and link to your pull requests on GitHub:</p>
<p><img src="/images/pr-done.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s better to do your assignments every month, you may not be willing to commit to it, and that is fine! If something comes up, you can skip a month. If you need more time for a module, you can stick to your assignment for longer. There&rsquo;s a solution as long as you want to keep participating.</p>
<h3 id="why-join">Why join?</h3>
<p>One reason is that this year might be your <a href="http://neilb.org/2018/01/01/cpan-prc-2018.html">last chance!</a> It may <a href="http://neilb.org/2018/01/06/what-after-prc.html">evolve</a>, but this will most likely be the <strong>last year</strong> you can get a CPAN module assignment.</p>
<p>I joined this challenge <a href="/posts/cpan-pr-challenge-012015/">in 2015</a> when I was still at college. It motivated me to read other people&rsquo;s code, even though I had a hard time understanding it. It also taught me a lot about the Open Source ecosystem. I did 4 assignments in 2015, another 4 in 2016, and doubled to 8 in 2017. I am also part of <a href="https://github.com/ziprecruiter">Team-ZipRecruiter</a>, which has been participating since April 2017. It really is fun!</p>
<p>If you are looking for more reasons, here are few:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a great way to study &ldquo;production ready&rdquo; code and communicate with fellow programmers</li>
<li>You can contribute to open source code, support Perl and build your resume</li>
<li>Assignments introduce you to code on CPAN that you otherwise might have missed</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re part of a group it could be a fun team-building event</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds interesting? Then send an email to Neil (&ldquo;neil at bowers dot com&rdquo;) with your GitHub username!</p>
